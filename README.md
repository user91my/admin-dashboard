## OVERVIEW :

- An admin dashboard app with tables and graphs.
- Mock data used in this application are generated using faker-js.
- There are buttons throughout the application that are merely placeholders (i.e. just for visual appearance) and have no functionality.

## NOTE ABOUT CHOROPLETH MAP :-

- The map in "/geography" route has very limited interactivity (i.e. no zoom-in/zoom-out and no dynamic scrolling) unlike proper map applications like leaflet-js.
